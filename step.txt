Message.tsx is created in the src folder
and exported to App.tsx

<Message /> passed to App.tsx for rendering Message.tsx to the DOM or App.tsx
we can return if else statement in the Message.tsx

installing a frame work bootstrap
npm i bootstrap@latest
then deleted the inbuild css files
then import bootstrap in the main.tsx

import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
then we can use bootstrap in the main.tsx

to dynamically change the name in tsx we use {item.map((item,index)=><li ClassName = "whatever in bootstrap" key = {index}>{item}</li>)}

we can write a statement or a function to ease the conditional problem and pass it from const or functionName()
or we can pass any logical statement at where we want to handle expection or error

we can use the useState() to change the state of the variable and use the setVariable() to change the state of the variable
we can use the useEffect() to change the state of the variable and use the setVariable() to change the state of the variable

to check independence we can double the instance of ListGroup in the App.tsx.
